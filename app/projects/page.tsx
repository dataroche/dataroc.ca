    <p>
      Status AI was a mobile app allowing anyone to chat with any persona,
      similar to what{' '}

        character.ai

      Joined the team urgently as a consultant to fix scaling issues. The app
      was gaining thousands of users daily and the backend and database were not
      enjoying the ride, to say the least.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Within 3 days, I had identified and fixed the most pressing issues
        related to the PostgreSQL database. In turn, this reduced monthly
        expenses by $12k.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within 3 weeks, I completely refactored the worker architecture to
        leverage Cloud Tasks instead of a custom implementation based on Redis.
        This also included a new worker service. This fixed a recurring issue
        where a peak of users would flood our Redis instance and essentially
        shut down our backend jobs queue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added error reporting and monitoring capabilities using Sentry, GCP
        Monitoring and custom dashboards on Retool.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As this project came to an end, I became the sole backend developer as the
      other two team members focused on frontend.

      Automated Crypto Trading Bots
    </ProjectHeader>
    <p>
      Started experimenting with liquidity mining on{' '}
      <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot Miner</a> around October
      2021. Iterations of custom bots built on top of the Pure Market Making
      strategy led to a steady 0.5% daily return.{' '}

    <p>
      Since the summer of 2022, I've been running grid bots and other market
      making bots for a steady stream of profits. The bots have a lower crypto
      exposure (beta) than a pure holding strategy, while still profiting from
      market volatility. I've built an extensive ecosystem around hummingbot to
      visualize trading and profit from market conditions.
    </p>
    <p>Some highlights:</p>
    <ul className="marker:text-neutral-200">
      <li>
        A custom-built grid trading strategy that can run on any
        Hummingbot-supported connector
      </li>
      <li>
        Streamlit dashboard to monitor profits, visualize trades and run
        backtests
      </li>
      <li>
        Real-time indexing of the BSC chain using{' '}
        <a href="https://ethereum-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
          Ethereum ETL

        and TimescaleDB to compress and retain data.
