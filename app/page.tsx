          When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing volley ball üèê, dancing
          salsa üï∫, but (who am I kidding) I'm probably coding. I love to
          travel, meet new people and experience extraordinary food. Latest
          travels: Denmark, the Canary Islands and London.

        <p>
          Dataroc is a portmanteau of <span className="text-sky">data</span> and

          What is that avatar/favicon?

          The avatar is named SOLeNOID and is the result of the creative genius
          of <a href="https://twitter.com/Logic_Beach">@logicbeach.eth</a>. It's
          the only NFT I possess, and proudly so! You can find{' '}
