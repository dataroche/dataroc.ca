---

I've recently been looking into the feasability of a small API to continuously aggregate
the prices of symbols accross multiple crypto exchanges. I often find myself trading on
lower liquidity exchanges to profit from wider spreads, but that brings the challenge of
knowing what is the "true" price of the symbol I'm trading. 

Public aggregator services usually have strict rate-limiting, and even when paying for a
premium service latencies are sub-optimal. For example, CoinGecko claims a 5 second
latency for its highest priced tier.

Read on to explore the feasability of collecting real-time data in order to provide an
aggregated true price!

The notebook used to generate the graphs in this post can be 
[interactively explored here](https://github.dataroc.ca/blog_post_connectors_latency_and_true_price).

## Data collection

This experiment uses CCXT and its `watch_ticker` websocket endpoint to stream the last
price. The frequency of updates depends on the exchange itself. In a subsequent post,
I'll dig into using the mid price from the order book streams as an aggregate price.

The data was collected over 2 days on 5 symbols: **AAVE/USDT**, **BTC/USDT**,
**COMP/USDT**, **CRV/USDT** and **ETH/USDT**. These symbols were picked semi-arbitrarily
(ETH, BTC and 3 smaller-cap tokens). You can download the input data
[here](https://github.dataroc.ca/conector_latency_and_true_price.parquet).

## Initial analysis

The initial analysis was meant to identify zones of relevant information. High activity,
or specific exchange behavior, throughout the dataset's duration.

For this purpose, the last price per symbol per exchange is downsampled to 5 minute intervals. Here is BTC/USDT as an example:

### (1) Latency varies by exchange, DB insertion could use some optimization

Latency depends heavily on the physical distance to the exchange's servers. I
anticipated North American exchanges to be quicker (Kraken, Coinbase Crypto.com), as the
script was running on my local network here in eastern Canada. As a tooling experiment, I measured 2 latencies: 

1. the latency between the timestamp provided by the server[^1] and when the script received the websocket message
2. the latency between the message reception and the insertion timestamp in a TimescaleDB database

#### 1. Exchange latency

The first latency checks the reliability of each exchanges at delivering updates and the
floor network latency. There isn't much that can be done here to improve the
performance. However, including the latency in an eventual true mid/last price might be
beneficial.

<small>The latency between exchange-stamped timestamp and the timestamp at which the message was received.</small>

One interesting experiment would be to compare websocket message timestamps with
historical data timestamps. Are the websocket timestamps delayed versus what exchanges
store as historical data? 

For example, bitmart and kraken shows that the exchange latency is at a median of 1ms. I
find it highly unlikely to receive messages on my local network with such ridiculously
low latency.

#### 2. Database insertion latency

The second latency is an experiment on the floor latency to expect between end-client
and an eventual API that serves this data. There doesn't seem to be a correlation
between market activity and db insertion performance. Instead, it an overall
optimization would be in order to reduce the 95th percentile and max values that are
unnaceptably high at over 100ms.

### (2) Last price is a trailing price

One immediately obvious issue is that exchanges with low trading activity boast
a last price that can be far from the apparent price of the market as a whole. This is
because the last price trails the actual exchange's order book. 

Although no trades happen, the market bid/ask orders are moving around as market makers
adjust their spreads. Take a look at binanceus with CRV/USDT:

<img src="/images/realtime-aggregate/crv_usdt_binanceus_jumps.png" alt="CRV/USDT shows how a low activity exchange has a trailing last price" />
<small>Notice how binanceus last price is static for long periods of time</small>

### (3) Cryto.com websockets were disconnected

Cryto.com only has data for CRV/USDT for about 6 hours. There were no retries nor
monitoring during the data collection of this experiment. It might be wise to have
fallback sockets, and obviously automated reconnection mechanisms.

## Computing a "true" last price

A possible "true" last price was computed here using a weighted average. I focused my
efforts on a small window with high volatility on the CRV/USDT symbol. 

The weights of each connector was computed using the whole dataset[^2]. The logic is simple and not optimized: 

1. We compute the change in price between successive updates of each exchange
2. We remove any 0 diff updates (some exchanges send updates regardless, others don't)
3. The weight of the exchange is the inverse of the variance of the absolute values of those diffs

The rationale is that an exchange with many small changes will have a small variance (bigger weight). An
exchange with rarer big changes will have a higher variance (smaller weight).

I highly recommend you explore this graph interactively and look at how the true price
behaves when there are sharp movements.

[^2]: In a real-time application the weights could be updated at a regular interval like
one hour using trailing data from the last week.

## Next steps

The major shortfall of the experiment presented here is in the usage of the last price
instead of using the bid/ask of each exchange. The next iteration will definitely use
the mid price as a basis for calculation, as it provides many advantages:

- No lag between what the market makers think the price is versus the last price
- The spread and frequency of trades is a better exchange weighing indicator than an
  arbitrary variance-based calculation

Moreover, adding trades data would provide the volume as an additionnal weighing
indicator: the more volume an exchange has, the higher its impact on the true price.
