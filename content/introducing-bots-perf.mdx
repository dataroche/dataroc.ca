I'm happy to introduce a new page on the website: [crypto bots performance](/crypto-bots)!
It's very rustic right now, but the infrastructure allows new features and charts to be added easily.

## Tech stack

This is the current tech stack as can be explored on [GitHub](https://github.com/dataroche/dataroc.ca):

- Website: written in React with Next.js and hosted on Vercel
- Database: PostgreSQL, hosted on fly.io
- API: PostgREST with graphile-migrate to setup tables and views, hosted on fly.io

## Data source

The crypto bots run on a private server.
Everyday, a job exports trading and balances data to the cloud database using a private tunnel.
